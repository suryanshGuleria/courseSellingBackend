# courseSellingBackend
Building a course selling app using nodeJS and express. Here we also setup a role base
access control system, where users and admin have seprate profiles and they have features
according to their roles.
Like admins can add new courses and edit course related data whereas users can purchase courses and can also view complete list of courses the app have to offer.
